How can I get the best out of it utilizing something familiar like SQL and how does this all fit together in an ever-evolving eco-system? This course will introduce the concepts of distributed computing, Hadoop and MapReduce and then goes into great detail into Apache Hive which is an SQL-like query language that can be used with Hadoop and NoSQL databases like HBase and Cassandra. The course presents some challenges you might experience solving real production problems and how Hive makes that task easier to accomplish.","link":"https://redhoop.com/pluralsight-sql-on-hadoop-analyzing-big-data-with-hive-9498-2.html","serviceName":"pluralsight.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"5","label":"Kenreisman/machine-learning  Top: Strata + Hadoop World 2014 Call for Proposal… http://t.co/WwpTdLhpq6, see more http://t.co/4sHJH6ZMNb","description":"Kenreisman/machine-learning  Top: Strata + Hadoop World 2014 Call for Proposal… http://t.co/WwpTdLhpq6, see more http://t.co/4sHJH6ZMNb","link":"http://strataconf.com/stratany2014/public/cfp/322?cmp=pe-strata-confpro-info-stny14_pc_email","serviceName":"twitter.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"4","label":"MLconf NYC | The Machine Learning Conference Presentations http://t.co/2sOEgmsbgh","description":"MLconf NYC | The Machine Learning Conference Presentations http://t.co/2sOEgmsbgh","link":"http://mlconf.com/mlconf-nyc-speakers/?utm_content=buffer91271&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","serviceName":"twitter.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"4","label":"Business Apps: 1monatiger, Zugang mit 150,- € Guthaben &amp;

Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.","link":"https://redhoop.com/coursera-web-intelligence-and-big-data-3892-2.html","serviceName":"coursera.org"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"3","label":"#SAP HANA in Action http://t.co/kRBZOJ6Fl6","description":"#SAP HANA in Action http://t.co/kRBZOJ6Fl6","link":"http://bddy.me/1htN7Ic","serviceName":"twitter.com"}]
