It is widely used by many large web applications like Twitter and Stackoverflow. However, getting started with Redis can be intimidating. A lot of developers find Redis is very different than relational databases like SQL Server or Oracle and even quite different than other NoSQL databases like MongoDB or RavenDB. In this course, you will begin to understand exactly what Redis is and how Redis works. You will walk through 5 data structures of Redis that will help you to understand how each data structure works and when you might use it. John will show you how to install Redis, both on a Windows machine for learning and testing and on a real Linux server for production use. You ll also learn about the ServiceStack.Redis C# client for accessing Redis from C# code. Finally, John will take you through the process of creating a real application with Redis and ASP.NET MVC4 as we put what we learned into practice.

In this course, author Joseph LeBlanc shows how to build an entire web application with CouchDB and introduces techniques such as querying with JavaScript, working with nested data, and creating views. He also explains some of the trade-offs you might encounter with NoSQL databases, such as the complexity of partitioning data across multiple servers, and presents five commonly used NoSQL databases: CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Riak, and Redis. Topics include: What is NoSQL? Installing CouchDB on Mac, Windows, and Linux Storing data Nesting document data Specifying search criteria Reducing data Attaching and retrieving images Deploying applications Securing CouchDB Understanding the CAP theorem","link":"https://redhoop.com/lynda-up-and-running-with-nosql-databases-2177-2.html","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"learningcourse","serviceName":"lynda.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"1","com.sap.ais.tax.core.uri":"content5563FC8CE70F4A55968B64F22CC616CE26F3CA64","label":"Python developer (Web Crawling, Machine Learning) http://t.co/NC5gzU6wJD #aws #html #java #nosql #linux #erlang... http://t.co/XJswKVcVHd","description":"Python developer (Web Crawling, Machine Learning) http://t.co/NC5gzU6wJD #aws #html #java #nosql #linux #erlang... http://t.co/XJswKVcVHd","link":"http://findmjob.com/job/cL1k7GbG4xGrrrzO9UscwA/Python-developer-Web-Crawling-Machine-Learning.html","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"content","serviceName":"twitter.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"1","com.sap.ais.tax.core.uri":"content3BD74E7F26541B8565B8EA341A3BEB69E2A956B7","label":"Python developer (Web Crawling, Machine Learning) http://t.co/NC5gzU6wJD #aws #html #java #nosql #linux #erlang... http://t.co/XJswKVcVHd","description":"Python developer (Web Crawling, Machine Learning) http://t.co/NC5gzU6wJD #aws #html #java #nosql #linux #erlang... http://t.co/XJswKVcVHd","link":"https://www.facebook.com/findmjobcom/posts/464358443696146","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"content","serviceName":"twitter.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"1","com.sap.ais.tax.core.uri":"content40582F0159A2EB2B06C369089A21E97DDF0FA2E0","label":"NoSQL and Relational ; Change - Great Read  (by Martin Fowler, Pramod Sadalage)","description":"Hi there,  great article for an overview (5min read): http://martinfowler.com/articles/nosql-intro.pdf &nbsp;  and another good one on change:   Let&#8217;s keep in mind that the whole point of developing software &#8211; that is, spending large sums of","link":"https://community.wdf.sap.corp/groups/bydesign-architecture/blog/2012/03/02/nosql-and-relational-change--great-read-by-martin-fowler-pramod-sadalage","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"content","serviceName":"SAP Community"}]
