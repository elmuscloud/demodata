This is often feasible and cost-effective when manual programming is not. Machine learning (also known as data mining, pattern recognition and predictive analytics) is used widely in business, industry, science and government, and  there is a great shortage of experts in it. If you pick up a machine learning textbook you may find it forbiddingly mathematical, but in this class you will learn that the key ideas and algorithms are in fact quite intuitive. And powerful! Most of the class will be devoted to supervised learning (in other words, learning in which a teacher provides the learner with the correct answers at training time). This is the most mature and widely used type of machine learning. We will cover the main supervised learning techniques, including decision trees, rules, instances, Bayesian techniques, neural networks, model ensembles, and suppor","link":"https://redhoop.com/coursera-machine-learning-3800-2.html","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"learningcourse","serviceName":"coursera.org"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"3","com.sap.ais.tax.core.uri":"content7D3D90EAD4A7700DC0CDFCF825C130B29F5C549E","label":"Data Science Training - Predictive Modelling, Visualisation,  Machine Learning and R - Basic and Advanced - June, Sy…http://t.co/H93ADQ69OS","description":"Data Science Training - Predictive Modelling, Visualisation,  Machine Learning and R - Basic and Advanced - June, Sy…http://t.co/H93ADQ69OS","link":"http://presciient.com/courses/sydney-training/","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"content","serviceName":"twitter.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"3","com.sap.ais.tax.core.uri":"learningcourse50F4751389920768B2613C88D7569A248DDD2619","label":"機器學習基石 (Machine Learning Foundations)","description":"Show Details Hide Details Welcome! The instructor has decided to teach the course in Mandarin on Coursera, while the slides of the course will be in English to ease the technical illustrations. We hope that this choice can help introduce Machine Learning to more beginners in the Mandarin-speaking world. The English-written slides will not require advanced English ability to understand, though. If you can understand the following descriptions of this course, you can probably follow the slides. [歡迎大家！這門課將採用英文投影片配合華文的教學講解，我們希望能藉這次華文教學的機會，將機器學習介紹給更多華人世界的入門者。課程中使用的英文投影片不會使用到艱深的英文，如果你能了解以下兩段的課程簡介，你應該也可以了解課程所使用的英文投影片。] Machine learning is an exciting field with lots of applications in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. It is also a very dynamic field, where many new techniques are being designed every day, and the hot techniques and theories at times can rise and disappear rapidly.

As machine learning is a very vast area, this course will be targeted more towards one of the machine learning methods which is neural networks. The course will try to make a base foundation first by explaining machine learning through some real world applications and various associated components. In this course, we ll take one of the open source machine learning framework for .NET, which is ENCOG. The course will explain how ENCOG fits into the picture for machine learning programming. Then we ll learn to create various neural network components using ENCOG and how to combine these components for real world scenarios. We ll go in detail of feed forward networks and various propagation training methodologies supported in ENCOG. We ll also talk about data preparation for neural networks using normalization process. Finally, we will take a few more case studies and wi","link":"https://redhoop.com/pluralsight-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-encog-3-7520-2.html","com.sap.ais.tax.core.type":"learningcourse","serviceName":"pluralsight.com"},{"TOTALCOUNT":"3","com.sap.ais.tax.core.uri":"learningcourse493A0B5963A992E197413163CB9775A912195F9","label":"Hilary Mason: Advanced Machine Learning","description":"In this sequel to \"An Introduction to Machine Learning with Web Data\", bit.ly lead scientist Hilary Mason shows you how to solve real-world problems with machine learning.
